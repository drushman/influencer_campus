Group page|Groups Page Header|Influ page header|<p>iConnect Groups are the life-blood of Paradise Community Church! Something amazing happens when we get together in a small group of people and share the goodness of God with one another. It&rsquo;s in small groups we can &ldquo;be ourselves&rdquo; and build trust, relationship and community, as well as develop our gifts and talents. At Paradise Community Church, we call them &ldquo;iConnect Groups&rdquo;, because we believe they are essential to a healthy life in God. If you work during the day, we have night iCoonect Groups across Adelaide, while if you&rsquo;re home during the day, Day iConnect Groups are a great way to get out of the house and spend time with others. If you&rsquo;re not part of an iConnect Group, see the iConnect Group listing for one nearest you and find out what you&rsquo;re missing!</p>|20NKpPTvSBg|bukiki-photo-tulips.png|Groups
